- Given a successful trajectory that can be extracted from a smaller environment.
- For views that contain an object we have that the mappings $$f$$ and $g$ are injective i.e. one-to-one.
- For views that don't contain an object the mappings $f$ and $g$ are surjective.  
- In some cases themappings may also be surjective for views with objects, however the number of elements in $A$ and $B $ is considerablys maller than in the non-object case.
